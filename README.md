## 👨‍💼 Current Role: Advisor Capacity Management | Sykehuspartner

I have a background in Data Science and Project Management, with certifications in PRINCE2 Agile Foundation and Lean. I am currently pursuing an Executive Master’s in Digitalization and Leadership at the University of Oslo, where I explore IT strategy, innovation, and leadership in digital transformation.

At Sykehuspartner HF, I work with data-driven decision support, Power BI reporting, and resource management in a project and portfolio management context. I have developed data models in Oracle SQL to support better project prioritization and resource allocation across departments.

My expertise spans IT project leadership, digital transformation, stakeholder management, and collaboration across technical and business domains. I have practical experience with agile methodologies (Scrum, Agile), and I plan to complete TOGAF and Leading SAFe certifications in Spring 2025.
